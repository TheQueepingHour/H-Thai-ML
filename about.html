            <p>
                The now renowned owner of H-Thai-ML opened his first restaurant in a small area on the outskirts of the South Side in Chicago.
                He learned he loved to cook as he was growing up with his father in the city. They would cook nearly every weekend, making up any recipe they could think of, and then took it to the next level by creating their own culinary arts.
                As our owner loved to cook, he also used the internet as often as he could so he could research different food pairings. In his search, he found himself learning about how websites are built: HTML. 
                His inquisitive mind drove him not only to dabble in programming, but allowing him to create a household name that families all over Chicago smile when they hear it.
                Our original location located at 1999 E Valley St, Chicago IL, was built on the corner where our owner would spend his free time in high school working, however when the building was bought out and demolished, the block was left with an empty lot.
                Our owner saved up for years to build the family favorite known throughout the country, and built it off of nothing but his own drive to see his dreams through, and the belief that he could bring the same joy through food, to all his customers.
                As the popularity of the restaurant grew, he finally realized he could achieve what he was after, and set out to spread his happiness, and tasty food to people far and wide.
